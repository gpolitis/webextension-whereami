## What is this?

Adds a cute flag button to the Firefox toolbar indicating your geolocation. You may click the button to display more information about your IP address. The addon is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/whereami/).

## How to use?

The extension uses the awesome [ipify](https://www.ipify.org) API to get your public IP address. ipify offers free and _unlimited_ requests, however it does not offer IP information. I could not find an accurate IP address data API that does not require registration, but thankfully there is a free-tier available from [IPInfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) which gives you 50k requests per month. That's way more than enough for normal personal usage. So in order to configure the extension you need to :

1. Register for a free account on [IPInfo.io](https://ipinfo.io)
2. Set your access token in the whereami extension preferences.
3. Profit!
